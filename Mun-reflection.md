# Git Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Understanding how my local files are synced with GitHub.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Understanding that it's less of a continuous sync between my local and GitHub, but rather GitHub holds the master code, and as a user, I sync to that. I need to align my local branches with what is in GitHub.


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Syntatical questions of how to work through the Git commands and how to understanding syncing.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
Just need to keep on practicing the work flow, but I feel much more confident about how git works now.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I enjoyed it. I found the guide very helpful. It's nice to have someone experienced watch me code and correct and even show me a few tips. It felt like having an older brother helping me out as I start out this coding journey!
